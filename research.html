<h3>Current Research Projects</h3>
<ul>
    <li>At ETS I am working on generating content for testing and educational applications. We're striving to build high-quality, bias-free solutions for education, and it's an exciting team to be a part of!</li>
    <li>Current Work:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>I work with automated generated language content, building systems to assess potential fairness issues that may arise. For more, see our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15104">BEA 2024 publication.</a></li>
        <li>I've also worked on various aspects of controlled content generation: building sentences for testing that contain the right vocabulary. For more, see our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15731">Industry Track at EMNLP 2022 Publication</a></li>
    </ul>
</ul>
    
<h3>Previous Projects</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I'm fascinated by creative language generation: exploring possibilities for generating all sorts of novel language (humor, metaphor, etc) using deep learning. Are end-to-end models sufficient, and if not, how can we improve them to handle this difficult area of language?</li>
    <ul>
        <li>We built a system to generate conceptual metaphors based on BART, Frame Semantics, and other tools: see our ACL paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01228">Metaphoric Generation with Conceptual Mappings</a></li>
        <li>Relatedly, we built a dataset of idiomatic and metaphoric paraphrases to explore natural language inference capabilities on figurative language:<a href="https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.369/">IMPLI: Investigating NLI Models' Performance on Figurative Language</a></li>
    </ul>

    <li>Crisis informatics: how can we provide concrete benefits and relief to those impacted by natural disasters using NLP technology?
        <ul>
            <li>I collaborated on a project attempting <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08535">automatically adapt to rapidly changing language during crises</a>, presented at the Findings of EMNLP 2022</li>
            <li> Our group explored <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12836">social media collection and analysis for crises events</a>, supporting citizen science efforts to annotate the never-ending stream of data that can contribute to our situational awareness, including the COVID-19 crisis. Our goal is to build a system for quick and efficient data collection and annotation to improve responses to natural hazards. Our collection uses the helpful <a href="https://github.com/lschmelzeisen/nasty">Nasty Scraper</a> for collection as well as the powerful <a href="https://inception-project.github.io/">INCEpTION</a> tool for annotation. Presented at EACL 2023.</li>
            <li>Check out my and my students' <a href="https://public.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/UKP_Webpage/publications/2020/2020_AAAI_FSS_SG_Data_Pipeline.pdf">work on a social good data collection pipeline</a>, presented at the <a href="https://ai-for-socialgood.github.io/">AAAI Fall Symposium on Social Good</a></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Doctoral dissertation on syntactically motivated approaches to metaphors, with <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/lab/clear/">the CLEAR group</a> under Profs. Martha Palmer and Jim Martin. I studied how syntax can influence metaphoric properties, and this can be leveraged to improve deep-learning metaphor detection.</li>
    <li>Supported lexical resources at the University of Colorado, including <a href="https://verbs.colorado.edu/verbnet/">VerbNet</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cu-clear/semlink">SemLink</a>.</li>
    <li>Worked for the <a href="https://epic.cs.colorado.edu/">Project Epic</a> lab with Profs. Leysia Palen and Kenneth M. Anderson. We collaborated with <a href="https://ncar.ucar.edu/">NCAR</a> to analyze responses to hurricanes, and build improved computaitonal methods for data analysis and exploration in order to assist researchers understanding the effects of natural disasters.</li>
