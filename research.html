<h3>Current Research Projects</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Currently working on creative language generation, exploring possibilities for generating all sorts of novel language (humor, metaphor, etc) using deep learning. Are end-to-end models sufficient, and if not, how can we improve them to handle this difficult area of language? This work is being done with the help of two BA thesis students, and we've seen promising results with regard to metaphors and humor: results forthcoming!</li>
  <li>Relatedly, I'm studying evaluation methods for language generation. Many metrics seem to perform well for literal language, or for certain tasks, but correlate negatively with metaphoric utterances. I've explored metrics and solutions, developing a system for better evaluation. Results are also forthcoming!</li>
    <li>I also work on social media collection for crises events, supporting citizen science efforts to annotate the never-ending stream of data that can contribute to our situational awareness, including the COVID-19 crisis. Our goal is to build a system for quick and efficient data collection and annotation to improve responses to natural hazards. Our collection uses the helpful <a href="https://github.com/lschmelzeisen/nasty">Nasty Scraper</a> for collection as well as the powerful <a href="https://inception-project.github.io/">INCEpTION</a> tool for annotation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Previous Projects</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Doctoral dissertation on syntactically motivated approaches to metaphors, with <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/lab/clear/">the CLEAR group</a> under Profs. Martha Palmer and Jim Martin. I studied how syntax can influence metaphoric properties, and this can be leveraged to improve deep-learning metaphor detection.</li>
    <li>Supported lexical resources at the University of Colorado, including <a href="https://verbs.colorado.edu/verbnet/">VerbNet</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cu-clear/semlink">SemLink</a>.</li>
    <li>Worked for the <a href="https://epic.cs.colorado.edu/">Project Epic</a> lab with Profs. Leysia Palen and Kenneth M. Anderson. We collaborated with <a href="https://ncar.ucar.edu/">NCAR</a> to analyze responses to hurricanes, and build improved computaitonal methods for data analysis and exploration in order to assist researchers understanding the effects of natural disasters.</li>
</ul>
