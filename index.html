        <ul>
          <li><em>May 2024</em>: I was fortunate to contribute to the work of <a href="https://ahmeshaf.github.io/cv/">Rehan Ahmed</a> and others at the University of Colorado, building a new dataset for event coreference using figurative language. The paper <a href="">Generating Harder Cross-document Event Coreference Resolution Datasets using Metaphoric Paraphrasing (link forthcoming)</a> has been accepted to the <a href="https://2024.aclweb.org/">ACL 2024 main conference</a>. Congratulations Rehan et al.!</li>
          <li><em>May 2024</em>: How is fairness in testing different from other contexts? We address challenges in generating fair test content using some clever promoting strategies in our paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15104">Identifying Fairness Issues in Automatically Generated Testing Content</a>, accepted to <a href="https://sig-edu.org/bea/2024">BEA 2024</a></li>
          <li><em>April 2024</em>: I was promoted to full Research Scientist, NLP at ETS! ðŸŽ‰</li>
          <li><em>Februrary 2023</em>: In <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2023.eacl-main.261/">Lessons Learned from a Citizen Science Project for Natural Language Processing</a>, our group at UKP explores citizen science data collection for NLP, at EACL 2023! </li>

        <ul>
          <li>I'm currently a Research Scientist, NLP at <a href="https://www.ets.org/">ETS</a>, working with the Automatic Content Generation team to build better education and testing tools!</li>
          <li>Previously, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher with Prof. Dr. Iryna Gurevych at the <a href="https://ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/">UKP Lab</a> in Darmstadt, Germany. </li>
          <li>Before that I was a research assistant at the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/lab/clear/">CLEAR Lab</a> at the University of Colorado under Prof. Martha Palmer while pursuing my PhD. I also worked for <a href="https://epic.cs.colorado.edu/">Project EPIC</a> under Prof. Leysia Palen.</li>

        <h3>Interests</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Responsible AI:</b> How can we ensure LLMs and other language technology is safe, fair, equitable, and sustainable? I'm particularly interested in issues surrounding safety, accessibility, and societal/environmental impacts.</li>
          <li><b>Language Generation</b>: Using language models (including but not limited to GPT) to generate text is fun, and getting better: how can we control the outputs to ensure they match our requirements while mitigating bias, fairness, and hallucination issues?</li>
          <li><b>Computational creativity</b>: How do machines process creative language? Can we detect it? Can we generate it? Metaphors, metonymy, sarcasm, humor, and more all pose significant challenges even to state-of-the-art systems. </li>
          <li><b>Crisis Informatics</b>: How do we best make of use of the massive amount of data created during crisis events (including natural disasters like hurricanes, terrorist events/wars, and pandemics like COVID-19)? Social media can help, but applying NLP can be challenging due to privacy, safety, and quality concerns.</li>
          <li><b>NLP for Social Good</b>: Relatedly, how can we leverage the vast amount of power AI has to improve people's lives in concrete ways? How do we deal with ethical issues, problems of inclusivity, and systematic bias in data, systems, and researchers?</li>
          <li><b>Language</b>: My background is originally in linguistics - I'm always interested in studying linguistic problems, particularly in semantics and pragmatics. Other areas of interest include construction grammar, frame semantics, and creative language. </li>
